# You Spin Me Round Robin

This lab is implementation for round robin scheduling with a given workload and quantum length. Then print out the average waiting time and average response time.

## Building

```shell
make
```

## Running

cmd for running

```shell
./rr processes.txt 3
```

results

```shell
Average waiting time: 7.00
Average response time: 2.75
```

## Cleaning up

```shell
make clean
```
